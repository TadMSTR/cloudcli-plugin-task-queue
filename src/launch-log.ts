 *
 * Written against that function rather than as a free-standing guess, and pinned to
 * it by a round-trip test, because a hardcoded regex here would drift silently from
 * the producer and the section would simply stop listing runs.
 *
 * The agent segment is greedy and the task segment is a fixed 8 hex chars anchored to
 * `.log`, so the split is unambiguous even if an agent name ever contains a hyphen.
 * Task ids are uuid4, so their first 8 characters are always lowercase hex.
 *
 * Returns null for anything that does not match. Callers must SKIP those rather than
 * guessing at an agent — two pre-2026-08 orphans in the live directory are named with
 * a bare task UUID and no agent, and a row with an empty agent is worse than no row.
