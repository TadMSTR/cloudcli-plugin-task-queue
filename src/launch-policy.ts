/**
 * Agent launch policy — the roster of how each agent's session is started.
 *
 * This plugin used to carry its own `AGENT_PROJECTS` literal in server.ts: a second
 * copy of a table `task-dispatcher.py` also spelled twice. It never gained a steward
 * entry, so the Start button could not launch steward at all — that drift IS
 * vikunja#523. The literal is deleted; both consumers now read one file,
 * `~/scripts/agent-launch.yml`, which ships in host-forge/scripts beside the dispatcher.
 *
 * Extracted from server.ts for the same reason control-api.ts and ws-guard.ts were:
 * server.ts calls server.listen() at import time, so a test importing it boots a
 * listener. Everything here is a pure function of its inputs.
 *
 * The validation is not decoration. The literal existed so no value outside a closed
 * set could reach a subprocess spawn; loading from a file does not preserve that by
 * itself, so every field is checked here against the same closed set the dispatcher's
 * validate_launch_policy() uses, and the WHOLE document is rejected on any violation.
 * A partially-honoured roster would silently launch some agent the wrong way.
