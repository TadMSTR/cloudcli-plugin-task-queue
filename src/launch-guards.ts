/**
 * Pre-launch credential guards, ported from task-dispatcher's launch path.
 *
 * WHY (plan agent-workflow-interop-2026-08, Phase 5.6)
 *
 * The dispatcher refuses to spawn a directly-launched agent without a resolved
 * `SCOPED_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` and without a usable Anthropic credential, and says which one
 * is missing by name. This plugin had neither check, so a Start could spawn a session
 * doomed to fail deep inside — a 401 from every scoped-mcp tool, or a `claude -p` that
 * short-circuits to "Not logged in" and never reads the task prompt. Both look, from the
 * operator's side, like an agent that started and did nothing.
 *
 * THE PORT IS NOT JUST THE TWO CHECKS. The dispatcher layers
 * `/opt/appdata/agents/<agent>/.env` into the child environment before checking it
 * (`load_agent_env`, mirroring what `run-scoped-mcp-http.sh` sources server-side); this
 * plugin spawned with a bare `{...process.env}`. Measured on forge: the CloudCLI process
 * env carries `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` but NO `SCOPED_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`. So a guard that
 * checked only `process.env` would have refused every non-run-as Start — correctly, in the
 * sense that those sessions really were starting without scoped-mcp tools, but that is the
 * bug rather than the fix. Layering the agent's own env is what makes the guard a guard
 * instead of a blanket refusal, and it is what the dispatcher has always done.
 *
 * THE RUN-AS ASYMMETRY IS DELIBERATE — DO NOT "FIX" IT
 *
 * Neither check runs for an agent with `runAsUser` set, exactly as in the dispatcher. For
 * such an agent the credentials are not in this process's environment BY DESIGN: they live
 * in a file owned by and readable only by the target user, and the launcher sources them as
 * that user. Running these checks on that path would fail every launch for the one agent
 * whose isolation is working correctly.
 *
 * The launcher performs the equivalent fail-loud checks itself, by name and as the right
 * user (`: "${VAR:?}"` on SCOPED_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN, TASK_QUEUE_TOKEN, GITHOST_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN,
 * CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN). What it cannot cover is the launcher itself being absent, and
 * the caller already checks that separately.

 * The quote handling repeats Python's `.strip().strip('"').strip("'")` in the same order,
 * because "one layer of quoting" and "all leading/trailing quote characters" differ on
 * inputs like `""x""` and the two sides must agree on which they implement.
